## Notes about Findings

Mean squared error % increase refers to the amount that the MSE increases when that variable is randomly shuffled/permuted. It seems from our RF that time spent yields a large % change in MSE and that it is very important in our prediction.

# Research questions

-   Is motivation relatively more predictive of course grades as compared to other online indicators of engagement?
    -   Which types of motivation are most predictive?
    -   Which types of trace measures are most predictive?

#general notes

    -   Mot variables include int/comp/utility
    -   Other variables include time spent, enrollment reason,frequ of discussion posts, quality of discussion posts (e.g. cognitive processing - liwc)
    -   we are including subject instead of course_ID bc 

# Main Findings

-   Overall prediction of RF model w/ motivation vs. without
-   Overall prediction of RF model w/ discussion board data and without

-   For each of those above, present mean residual values.

#Next steps 9.13.18
-   Josh will add a dataframe with 6-7 liwc summary stats - DONE
- text variables to add:
  - cogproc
  - social
  - posemo
  - negemo
  - perscon
  - n (this is the number of posts)
- note that we don't have this for the 100 or so students from the third semester
-   Emily will re-run the models, generate the output - maybe convert to an R markdown
-   File > new markdown > from template (papaja)

# Agenda for 9.21.18 Meeting
ACTION ITEMS:
    Josh:
    Emily:

    1.  CCS Concepts: 
        -   Applied computing ~ Education ~ Learning management systems
        -   Applied computing ~ Education ~ E-learning
        -   Applied computing ~ Education ~ Computer-managed instruction
        -   Others?  https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs_flat.cfm
    2.  Poster or short paper? Look at templates at links:
        -   Poster      https://lak19.solaresearch.org/posters-and-demonstrations/ 
        -   Papers      https://lak19.solaresearch.org/research-track/
    3.  If we do short paper - do you think we have some leeway with the headings? What headings would be good
        -   Do we need "Background and related work"
        
        
    4.  Division of writing labor for next 10 days (one proposition)
        -   Emily can do intro
        -
